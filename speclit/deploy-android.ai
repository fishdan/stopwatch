Deploy Android – Speclit

Objective
- Establish a reliable, repeatable process for deploying the CF Stopwatch Android app to the Google Play Store, including building signed release artifacts, managing versioning, and publishing updates.

Functional Requirements
- Build signed release AAB (Android App Bundle) for Google Play Store distribution.
- Manage version codes and version names consistently across releases.
- Store signing keys securely and configure signing in Gradle.
- Generate release notes and changelog for each version.
- Upload AAB to Google Play Console (internal testing, then production).
- Verify app functionality on test devices before production release.
- Track deployment history and version releases in progress.ai.

Build & Signing
- Use Gradle to build release AAB with proper signing configuration.
- Store keystore file securely (not in version control).
- Configure signing in `android/app/build.gradle` using keystore properties.
- Ensure ProGuard/R8 is configured for code optimization and obfuscation.
- Validate AAB structure and signing before upload.

Versioning
- Follow semantic versioning for versionName (e.g., 1.1.0, 1.2.0).
- Increment versionCode for each release (monotonically increasing integer).
- Update version in `android/app/build.gradle` before each build.
- Tag releases in git with version number (e.g., v1.1.0).
- Document version changes in progress.ai and release notes.

Google Play Console
- Upload signed AAB to Google Play Console.
- Start with internal testing track for validation.
- Promote to production after successful testing.
- Fill in release notes describing changes and improvements.
- Monitor crash reports and user feedback after release.

Testing & Validation
- Test release build on physical devices before uploading.
- Verify overlay functionality, permissions, and UI on different Android versions.
- Check app size and performance metrics.
- Ensure no debug code or logging in release build.

Documentation
- Document build process and signing setup in README or deployment guide.
- Maintain changelog of all releases.
- Record deployment steps and any issues encountered in progress.ai.

Open Questions
- Automate version bumping or keep manual?
- Set up CI/CD for automated builds and deployments?
- Use fastlane or other deployment automation tools?
