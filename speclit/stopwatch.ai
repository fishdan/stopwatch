Stopwatch Overlay App – Speclit

Objective
- Deliver a minimal cross-platform React Native stopwatch that stays on top of the screen while the phone is on, showing mm:ss:ff with start/stop toggle, clear, and close controls.

Functional Requirements
- Display format: mm:ss:ff (hundredths). Initial state 00:00:00.
- Controls: Start/Stop toggle pauses/resumes the timer; Clear resets to zero and stops; Close hides the overlay and stops timing.
- Overlay presence: Remains above other UI while the device is on. Android to use system overlay permission; iOS system-wide overlay is restricted—needs clarified fallback (in-app floating window vs Live Activity/Widget).
- Accuracy: Use monotonic time deltas; avoid drift over long runs; update UI at least every 100 ms with correct hundredth rounding.
- Lifecycle: Timer should pause when app/overlay is closed; optional resume state on reopen—clarify.

UI/Interaction
- Compact floating panel: timer text plus three buttons (Start/Stop, Clear, Close) with 44px+ touch targets.
- Visual hierarchy: high-contrast time; minimal chrome. Allow dragging to reposition (if feasible) without interfering with taps.
- Orientation: support portrait; clarify landscape expectations.

Platform Considerations
- Android: Requires SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW permission for overlays; likely needs a foreground service to stay on top when screen is on. Do not show over lock screen; close resets timer state.
- iOS: No general system overlay; acceptable fallback is in-app floating overlay (no lock-screen visibility). Live Activity/Widget not required unless easily available.
- Power: Avoid excessive intervals; compute elapsed time via timestamps instead of tight loops.

Open Questions
- Persistence: Closing should reset the timer; no persistence required.
- Dragging: Repositioning desired; implement drag affordance where platform allows.

Backlog (Speclit Tasks)
- SK-1 Align on overlay expectations per platform (Android overlay + foreground service; iOS in-app overlay fallback; no lock-screen visibility; closing resets timer; drag-to-reposition planned).
- SK-2 Scaffold React Native app (TypeScript), basic screen hosting overlay component, lint/test tooling.
- SK-3 Implement timer logic using monotonic timestamps; Start/Stop/Clear actions and display formatting to hundredths.
- SK-4 Android overlay implementation with permission request and foreground service to keep the panel on top; hook up controls to service.
- SK-5 iOS path based on decision (in-app overlay or Live Activity); implement chosen approach and constraints.
- SK-6 UI polish and accessibility (contrast, sizing, safe areas, drag if required).
- SK-7 QA: device/emulator checks on both platforms; document build/run steps.
