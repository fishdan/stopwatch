2025-12-23 Update – GitHub App bootstrap:
- Generated JWT and installation token for GitHub App ai-codex-dan; validated /app identity and /installation/repositories access.
- Confirmed installation permissions (write across contents, checks, workflows, secrets; no admin scopes) and repository visibility list from GitHub.
- Created /tmp/git-askpass.sh with the current installation token (expires 2025-12-24T00:09:39Z) and configured git user to ai-codex-dan[bot] with noreply email.
- Initialized git repository in /projects/fishdan/stopwatch; attempted to create GitHub repo fishdan/stopwatch via installation token but received 403 Resource not accessible by integration—awaiting guidance/permissions.
2025-12-23 Update – Repository creation and push:
- Remote set to https://github.com/fishdan/stopwatch.git after repo was provisioned; added .gitignore to keep secrets out of source control.
- Committed repo.ai, start.ai, progress.ai, and .gitignore with bot identity; pushed master with GIT_ASKPASS using installation token.
2025-12-23 Update – Speclit for stopwatch app:
- Drafted speclit/stopwatch.ai outlining goals, functional requirements, UI, platform considerations, open questions, and backlog tasks (SK-1..SK-7) for the RN overlay stopwatch.
- Captured iOS overlay constraints and need for platform decision before implementation.
