2025-12-23 Update – GitHub App bootstrap:
- Generated JWT and installation token for GitHub App ai-codex-dan; validated /app identity and /installation/repositories access.
- Confirmed installation permissions (write across contents, checks, workflows, secrets; no admin scopes) and repository visibility list from GitHub.
- Created /tmp/git-askpass.sh with the current installation token (expires 2025-12-24T00:09:39Z) and configured git user to ai-codex-dan[bot] with noreply email.
- Initialized git repository in /projects/fishdan/stopwatch; attempted to create GitHub repo fishdan/stopwatch via installation token but received 403 Resource not accessible by integration—awaiting guidance/permissions.
2025-12-23 Update – Repository creation and push:
- Remote set to https://github.com/fishdan/stopwatch.git after repo was provisioned; added .gitignore to keep secrets out of source control.
- Committed repo.ai, start.ai, progress.ai, and .gitignore with bot identity; pushed master with GIT_ASKPASS using installation token.
2025-12-23 Update – Speclit for stopwatch app:
- Drafted speclit/stopwatch.ai outlining goals, functional requirements, UI, platform considerations, open questions, and backlog tasks (SK-1..SK-7) for the RN overlay stopwatch.
- Captured iOS overlay constraints and need for platform decision before implementation.
2025-12-23 Update – Clarified requirements:
- User decisions: prioritize Android overlay; iOS can be in-app floating overlay; no lock-screen visibility; closing resets timer; drag-to-reposition desired.
- Updated speclit/stopwatch.ai to reflect resolved questions and backlog alignment.
2025-12-23 Update – RN scaffold and stopwatch UI:
- Created React Native project StopwatchApp (v0.73.6, TypeScript) with initial overlay stopwatch UI and controls (start/stop toggle, clear, close) and drag-to-reposition inside app; format mm:ss:ff using monotonic timestamps.
- Added Android manifest permissions for SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW and FOREGROUND_SERVICE to prep overlay service work.
- Close action resets timer and hides overlay; reopen affordance provided inside app.
2025-12-23 Update – Overlay permission scaffolding:
- Fixed overlay drag bounds and sizing constants; added Android overlay permission banner/button in UI.
- Implemented native module (OverlayPermissionModule/Package) to check/request SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW via settings; registered package in MainApplication.
