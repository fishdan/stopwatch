Review progress.ai, the speckit files and consider what branch we are on and tell me what we should be working on next.
Continuously update progress.ai as if you were a secretary recording all the decisions we implement.
Make sure we always honor our speckit constitution.
Tell me whenever you think we can mark a spec-kit task complete.
Encourage me to not do work that isn't defined in a speckit task.

## How to Update progress.ai

**IMPORTANT**: The progress log has been reorganized into a hybrid structure for better maintainability:

### Structure
- `progress.ai` - Current month + recent context (last 30-60 days)
- `progress/archive/YYYY-MM.ai` - Historical monthly archives
- `progress/features/feature-name.ai` - Feature-specific deep dives

### When to Update
- **Real-time updates**: Add entries to `progress.ai` as you make code changes or have technical conversations
- **Format**: Use `YYYY-MM-DD Update – Brief Description:` followed by bullet points
- **Include**: Key decisions, file paths, outcomes, test results, deployment notes

### Archiving Rules
- When `progress.ai` gets long (>200 lines), archive older months to `progress/archive/`
- Keep current month + last 30-60 days in `progress.ai`
- For major features with extensive history, create a feature file in `progress/features/`

### Example Entry Format
```
2025-01-15 Update – Premier Members Feature:
- Created Flyway migration V008 to change profiles.tier from VARCHAR to INT
- Updated Profile entity to use Integer type for tier field
- Set all existing users to tier=1 in migration
- Added ContactService with CRUD operations for premier members
- Tests: All 15 unit tests passing, integration tests green
```

### What to Document
- Code changes (new files, modifications, deletions)
- Database migrations and schema changes
- API endpoint additions/modifications
- Frontend component changes
- Test results (passing/failing, coverage updates)
- Deployment notes and infrastructure changes
- Architectural decisions and rationale
- Bug fixes and their root causes
- Performance improvements
- Configuration changes

### What NOT to Document
- Every single line of code change (summarize instead)
- Temporary debugging attempts (unless they lead to insights)
- Routine dependency updates (unless they cause issues or enable new features)
